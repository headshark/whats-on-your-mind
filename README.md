# What's On Your Mind?

This project is completed as part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Front End Nanodegree Program. The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the project. I needed to add the ajax request using three different methods:
* the XHR object
* jQuery's `.ajax()` method
* the Fetch API
